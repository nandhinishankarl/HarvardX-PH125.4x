Data Import
Import the brexit_polls polling data from the dslabs package and set options for the analysis:

# suggested libraries and options
library(tidyverse)
options(digits = 3)

# load brexit_polls object
library(dslabs)
data(brexit_polls)
Final Brexit parameters
Define  𝑝=0.481  as the actual percent voting "Remain" on the Brexit referendum and  𝑑=2𝑝−1=−0.038  as the actual spread of the Brexit referendum with "Remain" defined as the positive outcome:

p <- 0.481    # official proportion voting "Remain"
d <- 2*p-1    # official spread

Question 1: Expected value and standard error of a poll


The final proportion of voters choosing "Remain" was  𝑝=0.481 . Consider a poll with a sample of  𝑁=1500  voters.

What is the expected total number of voters in the sample choosing "Remain"?

N <- 1500
N*p

What is the standard error of the total number of voters in the sample choosing "Remain"?

 se <- sqrt((p*(1-p))/N) 
 
What is the expected value of  𝑋̂  , the proportion of "Remain" voters?

X_hat <- p

What is the standard error of  𝑋̂  , the proportion of "Remain" voters?
