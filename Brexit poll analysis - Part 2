Question 4: Confidence intervals for polls in June

Create the data frame june_polls containing only Brexit polls ending in June 2016 (enddate of "2016-06-01" and later). We will calculate confidence intervals for 
all polls and determine how many cover the true value of  ùëë .

First, use mutate() to calculate a plug-in estimate se_x_hat for the standard error of the estimate  SE^[ùëã]  for each poll given its sample size and value of  
ùëãÃÇ   (x_hat). Second, use mutate() to calculate an estimate for the standard error of the spread for each poll given the value of se_x_hat. 
Then, use mutate() to calculate upper and lower bounds for 95% confidence intervals of the spread. Last, add a column hit that indicates whether the 
confidence interval for each poll covers the correct spread  ùëë=‚àí0.038 .

Code:

june_polls <- brexit_polls %>%
            filter(enddate > "2016-06-01") %>%
            mutate(x_hat = (spread+1)/2,
                    se_x_hat = sqrt(x_hat*(1-x_hat)/samplesize),
                    lower = (x_hat - qnorm(0.975)*se_x_hat)-.5,
                    upper = (x_hat + qnorm(0.975)*se_x_hat)-.5,
                    hit_0 = lower <= 0 & upper >= 0,
                    hit_remain = lower > 0,
                    hit_actual = 2*lower < d & 2*upper > d)

How many polls are in june_polls?

nrow(june_polls)

What proportion of polls have a confidence interval that covers the value 0?

mean(june_polls$hit_0)

What proportion of polls predict "Remain" (confidence interval entirely above 0)?

mean(june_polls$hit_remain)

What proportion of polls have a confidence interval covering the true value of  ùëë ?

mean(june_polls$hit_actual)

Question 5: Hit rate by pollster

Group and summarize the june_polls object by pollster to find the proportion of hits for each pollster and the number of polls per pollster. 
Use arrange() to sort by hit rate.

groupedpolls <- june_polls %>% group_by(pollster) %>% 
summarize(hit = mean(hit_actual), polls = n()) %>% 
arrange(desc(hit))

Question 6: Boxplot of Brexit polls by poll type

Make a boxplot of the spread in june_polls by poll type.

bplot <- june_polls %>% group_by(poll_type) %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_boxplot(aes(poll_type, spread))

Question 7: Combined spread across poll type

Calculate the confidence intervals of the spread combined across all polls in june_polls, grouping by poll type. Recall that to determine the standard error 
of the spread, you will need to double the standard error of the estimate.

Use this code (which determines the total sample size per poll type, gives each spread estimate a weight based on the poll's sample size, 
and adds an estimate of p from the combined spread) to begin your analysis:

combined_by_type <- june_polls %>%
        group_by(poll_type) %>%
        summarize(N = sum(samplesize),
                  spread = sum(spread*samplesize)/N,
                  p_hat = (spread + 1)/2)

Answer:

combined_by_type <- june_polls %>%
            group_by(poll_type) %>%
            summarize(N = sum(samplesize),
                        spread = sum(spread*samplesize)/N,
                        p_hat = (spread+1)/2,
                        se_p_hat = 2*sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/N),    
                        lower = (spread - (qnorm(0.975)*se_p_hat)),
                        upper = (spread + (qnorm(0.975)*se_p_hat)))
